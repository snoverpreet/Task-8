# Task-8

**Working with VPNs**

**Step 1: Choose and Sign Up for a Free VPN**

Examples:

ProtonVPN Free Tier – Good privacy reputation, no data limits.

Windscribe Free – 10 GB/month data limit, multiple servers.

**I choose: https://turbovpn.com/download/windows | Turbo VPN for Windows PC**

Tips:

Use a valid email if the VPN requires account verification.

Avoid shady free VPNs — they might log or sell your data.

**Step 2: Download and Install the VPN Client**

Go to the official VPN website.

Download the app for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS).

Install by following the prompts (accept terms, choose install location, etc.).

**Step 3: Connect to a VPN Server**

Open the VPN app.

Sign in with the account you just created.

Select a server location:

Closest location = better speed.

Far location = more anonymity, possibly slower.

Click “Connect.”

**Step 4: Verify IP Address Change**

Visit whatismyipaddress.com before connecting to the VPN and note your real IP & location.

Visit again after connecting — you should see a new IP and location.

**Step 5: Test Encrypted Browsing**

Go to a few websites (e.g., https://example.com or news sites).

Ensure they load normally — your traffic is now encrypted and going through the VPN tunnel.

**Step 6: Disconnect & Compare**

Disconnect the VPN in the app.

Test browsing speed both with and without VPN:

Visit speedtest.net.

Expect slightly slower speeds when connected to VPN due to encryption overhead.

**Step 7: Research VPN Encryption & Privacy**

Look into:

Encryption protocol (e.g., OpenVPN, WireGuard).

Privacy policy: Does the VPN log your data?

Jurisdiction: Where is the company based? (Affects data privacy laws.)

Extra features: Kill switch, DNS leak protection.

**Step 8: Report**

**Structure:**

**Objective –** State the purpose of using a VPN.

**Setup Steps –** Summarize installation & connection process.

**Connection Status Screenshot –** Show VPN app “connected” + IP change proof.

**Speed Test Results –** Compare with & without VPN.

**VPN Benefits –** e.g., hides IP, encrypts traffic, bypasses restrictions.

**VPN Limitations –** e.g., slower speeds, free plan restrictions, not 100% anonymous.

**Conclusion –** Reflect on how VPNs improve privacy and security.
